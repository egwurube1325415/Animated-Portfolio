      Growing up in a family filled with mathematicians and engineers, it always excites me how my older cousins would break down different systems to mundane things we undertake daily. For example, when washing the dishes, the planning stage involves making sure all the materials(sponge, dish soaps, and paper towel) needed are available and, the pots, plates and cutleries are all partitioned in different sections to be easily accessible. The implementation stage involed the washing, rinsing and drying of the dishes. Finally, they would classify the the maintenance stage as the cleaning and racking up of the dishes. They would always create algorithms to each section in to find a better, smarter and faster way to perform the same task. These impressions influenced my decision to initially pursue a master's degree in Engineering Management. I wanted to be part of the processes and intuitions who came up with innovative ways to carry out mundane activites using current technologies.<br>

     This fascinating passion has helped me to contribute to peoples lives in Texas Dept of Criminal Justice at different levels. I was privileged to work on projects that introduced me to Web Development and programming. This is my proverbial "red pill" which is taking me and my skill sets deeper the rabbit whole.<br>
      
      I am skilled in creative and critical thinking, product and Operations Management, research work, Teamwork and Collaboration and a master Communicator.

              The idea of this project came from the concept of virtual assistants like siri, which will tell you a joke. <br>
              Basically we called a joke API to get a random Joke then pass it to a text to speech API, so our assistant would tell us the joke. Enjoy, lol!

              This Project highlights some of my pass time hobbies, the music player has all the main functionalities of any music player; the pause/play button, the fast foward and rewind button, associating an album cover to each song, being able to pin point a specific time on the progress line to be able to enjoy this player to the fullest.

              This project is use to create an application to help users to be able to calculate the total payments and interest when they are considering taking a loan. <br>

              The total interest paid  <br>

              This project is similar to that of an alarm clock, but it shows days, hours, minutes and the seconds. <br>
              The cool aspect of this project is that we are able to store the count in our local storage so it can be refreshed, we can leave the page and count would still continue. <br>
              As an added bonus, if you can wait for the countdown to be completed, i have a surprise bonus for you.
